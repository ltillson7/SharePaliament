The APIs I am using are from :
https://developers.facebook.com/docs/javascript
AND
http://api.openparliament.ca/

My idea behind this assignment is that politics and our understanding of it has become 
increasingly important. I think that sharing what bills are in circulation in a public 
forum is vital, and it's equally vital to know which politicians are responsibile for your well-being. 
Unfortunately, the public forum I have chosen is Facebook. Another downside is that 
the Parliamentary API that I have chosen hasn't been updated recently. 


To run the index file I used ngrok. I would run ngrok and then add that url to the Facebook Developers page 
which has an APP ID associated with the index page.
